## Women in Dichotomy

1. **The Concept**

Women in Indian society have conventionally been portrayed as either of the two - a goddess or an evil creature. This has a lot to do with the patriarchal social system and religion.

2. **The Goddess Archetype**

Women are often revered as goddesses, embodying ideals of purity, sacrifice, and devotion. Even the strongest of the women figures in the religious texts, such as Goddess Durga and Goddess Lakshmi are shown as family-centred women, submissive to their male consorts. That’s just one example of religion’s impact. Women in Indian conservative society are expected to fulfil their roles as wives and mothers, while being devoted to their male ‘guardians’. This will earn one the title of ‘goddess’ or ‘pure woman’.

3. **The Evil Archetype**

Conversely, women who defy these roles or assert their independence are often labelled as evil or immoral. Women who challenge patriarchal norms, face social ostracism and stigmatisation. They are often blamed for ‘ruining the Indian culture’, while they ask for equal rights. Of course, how can equal rights be our culture, right?

4. **Cultural and Religious Underpinnings**

The dichotomy is deeply rooted in cultural narratives and religious texts that dictate women's roles. For instance, the Manusmriti outlines strict guidelines for women's behaviour, emphasising subservience to male authority figures throughout their lives. This religious sanctioning of gender roles perpetuates the cycle of oppression.

5. **Impact on Career Choices**

This dichotomy hinders positive societal changes and women empowerment. People who are adherent to such baseless norms will discourage women from higher studies, jobs and other aspirations to become a devoted wife.

6. **Internalisation and Identity**

Women who are forced to conform to these patriarchal norms may internalise it and identify themselves as inferior to men and incapable of living independently. They tend to perpetuate this among other younger women in the family and in the society as well.
