*In our quest to understand the cause of existence, we invented hundreds of religions. By now, those who have allowed their minds to wander beyond conformity are aware of the pitfalls of that approach. Let's be clear; this isn't a religious stance or a scientific endeavor. It lacks a definitive truth or a testable hypothesis. At most, it can be termed a philosophical perception, closely resembling a metaphysical explanation. Whether you choose to accept, question, or reject it is entirely up to you.*

## Part 1: All from Nothing

### The Nature of Nothing

What made the tranquil nothing to split? It's almost as if the stillness and the turbulence coexisted. Every bit of infinite chaos was contained within the serene. Was there a spark that made it break free? Was that internal or external to the nothingness? The passive God wakes up one day and chooses to create everything, or rather, to become everything. What woke them up? What made them want to create? What were they doing before that? Sleeping eternally? No. It's not their first creation. It was sleep of rest, rest after destruction, the withdrawal of first creation. Our dear God, weary of playing, falls asleep. Wait, but don't they have infinite energy to go on with one single creation forever? They don't wish to. The fun of building a sandcastle comes with the tide. God has to be all that. If it's going on for eternity how is it that all possibilities are not exhausted? It is because the possibilities take place simultaneously but they are experienced separately. The end for us is just a break for God.

### The Split

Was there really a beginning where every matter, everything along with their opposites, originated from nothing? Positive and negative qualities of every being, spanning the highest and lowest levels of relativity, came into existence. Time manifested in its three major forms - past, present, and future. Consciousness split into uncountable fragments, each one called a self.

### Fragmented Reality

Have you ever tried to perceive everything as a whole? Grasping infinity is challenging. Even though we understand that infinity implies an endless process, containing it would take infinite time unless one starts seeing that it doesn't have to be a progressive method. It's just there. Various scriptures across religions state that living beings (and in some cases, just humans) are minute parts of God. God could be everything we collectively sacrificed or collectively desired, or an exchange system of the two. "And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light." Everything is already there. Our perception is limited. We can express things in formulas or words, but to what extent do we experience it? One's restless, eternally-perceiving mind may stop and feel due to someone's intervention and observation. They could be the same person or different people. It's our individual experiences but it takes place in relation to other beings. There is interaction.

## Part 2: All or Nothing

### The First Deception

When we imagine our ideal reality, most of us think there should be order and goodness. But who makes that a mandate? Is there an ideal situation at all? If so, who decides it? Why can't people see eye-to-eye on that? Even though some philosophies are for greater welfare and some threats are disguised with oppression, the means to achieve such a world are not the same in everyone's mind. Even when it's achieved, it doesn't stay that way for long. To some people, the order is too much control and goodness is subjective.

### The Assumed Opposition

The narrative that one's opposite to another is relative. One considers another their opposition in relation to self. It's a seesaw, one has to first assume a side to have an opposing force. We think order and free flow are opposite of each other.

### Order and Chaos

Order and chaos are intertwined. Even in the human world, the order is nothing but a layout of the flow. It's only through intervention that something is made sense of, like how an image is formed when light faces an obstruction. Something exists for us only when we stop to perceive it. The concept of last year exists for us when we stop and look back right from this day backward. Order is a progressive path to perceive the chaos, so that we understand it better. Order is progressive. Absolute order is impossible. Disorder spreads outwards and so does control.

## Part 3: All for Nothing

### You are a Million Butterflies

Life itself is the entropy. Everything that has a sense of existence is triggering a butterfly effect. Once the process is set in motion, there's no going back to the previous state. That's the whole point of it. It can only move to an end to restart in a slightly varied form. Every self that is created, each one that's ended has affected another one. No living or non-living being is in total isolation from the effect of others. Even at the highest form, a self must indulge in the creation, although as an actor with a predetermined role.

### The End

Is there a goal for everything? Only one we can see, that is, to move forward, together. There will be more chaos, more suffering and more wish for an end, yet, we move forward, for the journey is the goal itself. There is no greater purpose. The fact that every self dies is a matter of fear and relief at the same time. The conflicting desires of life and death exist in us for that reason.
