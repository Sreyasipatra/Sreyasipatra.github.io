## Stanley Cup in India

The ‘emotional support water bottles’ are a matter of sensation now. Much of it can be attributed to Stanley Cup’s dope marketing strategy. What better way to tap into the minds of youngsters than social media trends!

Stanley cups exploit a few psychological triggers of its target audience - fear of missing out, desire to be included, urge to maintain social status and to remain trendy. These quenchers, with a price tag more than many Indians’ monthly salary being sold here, is a demonstration of peak consumerism. It showcases how social media rewires the brain into craving materials without weighing the value for money.

The marketers of Stanley bottles create a sense of urgency by releasing limited-edition colours and designs. They also foster a community, encouraging them to share their collections, which aids the urge to buy one. With disposable income and increasing social needs of urban young women, who lack a third place to socialise, and love to relate to social media captions like “I am just a girl”, Stanley cup sales are on the rise.

*And just like that, responsible expenditure goes down the drain!*
