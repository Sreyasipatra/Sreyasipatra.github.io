## India’s Performance in GHI

India has ranked 105th among 127 countries in the Global Hunger Index, with a score of 27.3, categorized in the ‘serious’ hunger level. In 2000, the score was 38.4, indicating alarming hunger levels. By 2015, it improved to 29.2, still classified as serious. The latest score of 27.3 reflects only a marginal advancement since then.

### Key Indicators

- **Undernourishment**: Approximately 13.7% of India's population is undernourished, reflecting insufficient caloric intake.
- **Child Stunting**: The stunting rate among children under five is reported at 35.5%, indicating chronic undernutrition.
- **Child Wasting**: Alarmingly, India has the highest child wasting rate globally at 18.7%, reflecting acute malnutrition.
- **Child Mortality**: The under-five mortality rate stands at 2.9%, partly due to inadequate nutrition and poor health conditions.

### Government's Response

The Indian government has consistently contested its GHI rankings, labeling them as flawed and not reflective of ground realities. Officials argue that:
- The methodology used by GHI is questionable, particularly regarding child wasting statistics derived from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).
- Poshan Tracker shows significantly lower rates of child wasting at around 7.2%. We need to think about the credibility of this claim.

### Economic Growth and Food Security

With all the hype about India being the fastest growing economy, what does this report reflect? A disproportionate growth. While India has experienced robust economic growth, the benefits have not been equitably distributed, leaving marginalized communities vulnerable to food insecurity. Where and how the government expenditures take place need to be reassessed and restructured. A well-distributed economic growth should be the goal.
