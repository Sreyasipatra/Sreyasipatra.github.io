## Casteism in India

The roots of casteism in India is in the religious scriptures like the Vedas and the Smritis. Although apologists claim that this caste-system is based on occupation and is not hierarchical, we see otherwise in the real world. The four main branches of the caste system are Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. There are hundreds of subcastes in India right now, and the caste identity is passed on patrilineally, by birth.

The man-made hierarchy of human life value can be seen in nook and corners of India. Various types of discriminatory behaviors towards the so-called lower caste people, sometimes leading to physical violence, is quite common. There are instances of beating and killing of lower caste people for using public facilities. Untouchability has not been completely eradicated yet. The people at the bottom of the hierarchy have separate neighborhoods, separate water sources, and a denial of access to public facilities. Every development taking place in a village is first enjoyed by the upper-caste people.

Caste-based discrimination limits economic opportunities for lower-caste individuals. Many are confined to menial jobs or traditional occupations associated with their caste, often with little chance for upward mobility. This economic marginalization is compounded by a lack of access to quality education and healthcare facilities, further entrenching poverty within these communities.

Another important reason for fostering this discrimination is caste-based politics. Vulnerable people have always been used as vote banks by politicians. The fake promises of development hardly materialize after the position is won. Even if some development takes place it only helps in reinforcing the caste identities, thereby making the communities more vulnerable.

Casteism remains a significant barrier to social justice and equality in India. Despite constitutional provisions aimed at eradicating caste-based discrimination, practical change is insignificant. The social leaders have to be considerate and take charge to bring about real changes. Religious preachers too have a responsibility in this matter. Meanwhile, we can play our individual parts, by removing the stigma from our minds, raising our voices against it and making people aware of the harms of this system.
