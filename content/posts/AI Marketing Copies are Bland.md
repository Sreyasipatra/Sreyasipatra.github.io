## AI Marketing Copies are Bland

The sheer lack of originality and personal touch in AI generated marketing copies is very prominent. Generic sentences with fake exclamation make it seem like there was no real effort put in that, which is somewhat true.

Although a good prompt can generate a moderately unique-looking copy, it still lacks the human touch, which is an abstract factor well recognised by our brains. To capture the attention of the audience we need creativity and tailor it as per the demography.

It takes only a minute to generate a copy with AI tools with minimal cost but it lacks the essence. It seems like the brand doesnâ€™t care to hire human writers and gets it done without any regard for creative calibre.

AI generated copies can be free and require little effort but it significantly compromises with the quality and its use portrays the brand in a negative light as well. AI has a long way to go to effectively replace humans.
