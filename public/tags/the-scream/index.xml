      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a scream. I woke up panting. Reality was no longer cognizable to me. It had been like that for quite a while. My schizophrenia medications were not infallible after all. I had some water and checked the time. It’s 02:53. No, 02:23. But honestly, who cares? Time is just a book of memories for me. I remember two things I did today, about thirty minutes total. That’s it. Twenty-four hours of the day are compressed into thirty minutes for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
