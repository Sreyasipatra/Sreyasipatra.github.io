## How to know if it’s fake?
Astrology is always fake, a scam. It has no definite proof of working. Generalised statements with narrative manipulation is what makes it seem real. For example, someone avoids an accident by an inch. An astrologer may say, it is a sign of bad luck. They may also say that the person is lucky to have survived. It depends on what will serve the purpose.

## I would never...
Even logical and sceptical people are lured into astrological readings when they go through a low phase in life. Now that astrology business is digitised too, the ads will find a place in our devices. If one is going through a rough patch, they will want a way out no matter how illogical the method may sound. One may change their own beliefs to fit that nonsense explanation given by an astrologer.

## Fearmongering
When one sees through the facade of an astrologer and wants out, more fear is used to keep them hooked to it. Fear of harm to one’s family, fear of losses, fear of legal complications etc. makes one weak enough to stick to the process of astrological solutions.

## Selling of hope-stones
False future-reading is not the only way astrologers scam people. They also sell stones at exorbitant prices which supposedly solves the astrological faults in one’s birth chart. They don’t even provide authenticity certificates of the stones and metals. They sell these stones for thousands of rupees per ten grams.

## Conclusion
Astrologers are a nuisance to society. Such an unscientific and fraudulent practice is rampant in the name of personal faith. The harm it causes to people is not accounted for. The authorities pretend that there are ‘good’ and ‘bad’ astrologers, while the reality is that all of them are scamming vulnerable people.
