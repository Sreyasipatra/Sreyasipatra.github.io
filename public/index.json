Although apologists claim that this caste-system is based on occupation and is not hierarchical, we see otherwise in the real world. The four main branches of the caste system are Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. There are hundreds of subcastes in India right now, and the caste identity is passed on patrilineally, by birth.\nThe man-made hierarchy of human life value can be seen in nook and corners of India. Various types of discriminatory behaviors towards the so-called lower caste people, sometimes leading to physical violence, is quite common. There are instances of beating and killing of lower caste people for using public facilities. Untouchability has not been completely eradicated yet. The people at the bottom of the hierarchy have separate neighborhoods, separate water sources, and a denial of access to public facilities. Every development taking place in a village is first enjoyed by the upper-caste people.\nCaste-based discrimination limits economic opportunities for lower-caste individuals. Many are confined to menial jobs or traditional occupations associated with their caste, often with little chance for upward mobility. This economic marginalization is compounded by a lack of access to quality education and healthcare facilities, further entrenching poverty within these communities.\nAnother important reason for fostering this discrimination is caste-based politics. Vulnerable people have always been used as vote banks by politicians. The fake promises of development hardly materialize after the position is won. Even if some development takes place it only helps in reinforcing the caste identities, thereby making the communities more vulnerable.\nCasteism remains a significant barrier to social justice and equality in India. Despite constitutional provisions aimed at eradicating caste-based discrimination, practical change is insignificant. The social leaders have to be considerate and take charge to bring about real changes. Religious preachers too have a responsibility in this matter. Meanwhile, we can play our individual parts, by removing the stigma from our minds, raising our voices against it and making people aware of the harms of this system.\n","permalink":"//localhost:9218/posts/casteism-in-india/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"casteism-in-india\"\u003eCasteism in India\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roots of casteism in India is in the religious scriptures like the Vedas and the Smritis.

The latest score of 27.3 reflects only a marginal advancement since then.\nKey Indicators Undernourishment: Approximately 13.7% of India\u0026rsquo;s population is undernourished, reflecting insufficient caloric intake. Child Stunting: The stunting rate among children under five is reported at 35.5%, indicating chronic undernutrition. Child Wasting: Alarmingly, India has the highest child wasting rate globally at 18.7%, reflecting acute malnutrition. Child Mortality: The under-five mortality rate stands at 2.9%, partly due to inadequate nutrition and poor health conditions. Government\u0026rsquo;s Response The Indian government has consistently contested its GHI rankings, labeling them as flawed and not reflective of ground realities. Officials argue that:\nThe methodology used by GHI is questionable, particularly regarding child wasting statistics derived from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS). Poshan Tracker shows significantly lower rates of child wasting at around 7.2%. We need to think about the credibility of this claim. Economic Growth and Food Security With all the hype about India being the fastest growing economy, what does this report reflect? A disproportionate growth. While India has experienced robust economic growth, the benefits have not been equitably distributed, leaving marginalized communities vulnerable to food insecurity. Where and how the government expenditures take place need to be reassessed and restructured.

With this mindset, we often overlook the fact that these individuals make critical decisions about how we live. Many of us like to call ourselves apolitical, viewing politics as a distant realm that does not affect our daily lives. However, the reality is quite different.\nImpact on Essential Services The most immediate way politics affects daily life is through the provision of essential services such as healthcare, education, and public safety. Government policies dictate how these services are funded and delivered. Inadequate medical and educational infrastructure, along with various disparities, often stem from poor political planning and corruption. For instance, communities may suffer from insufficient healthcare facilities or underfunded schools due to mismanagement at the political level.\nEconomic Opportunities Political decisions also play a crucial role in shaping economic opportunities for individuals. Policies regarding taxation, labour laws, and business regulations directly impact the quality of life for the workforce and their dependents. For common people, job security or insecurity is heavily influenced by the prevailing political climate. When governments prioritise corporate interests over public welfare, it can lead to job losses and economic instability for ordinary citizens.\nCommunity Engagement Politics shapes how individuals engage with their communities. Local governance structures—such as panchayati raj institutions in rural areas—have the potential to empower citizens to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives directly. However, these political bodies often resist change, particularly regarding women’s rights and other social issues. This resistance can stifle community development and perpetuate inequalities.\nPolitical Awareness and Civic Participation Political awareness encourages civic participation; when people understand their rights and responsibilities within a democratic framework, they are more likely to engage in community initiatives or advocate for change. However, apathy towards politics often stems from disillusionment with elected representatives who prioritize personal gain over public service. This disconnection can lead to a lack of trust in political institutions.\nSocial and Environmental Issues Politics also plays a significant role in addressing social and environmental issues. Poor political policies or ineffective implementation can perpetuate discrimination based on religion, caste, gender, and sexuality. Environmental sustainability laws depend on the political climate; inadequate regulations can lead to ecological degradation that affects everyone.\nThe Role of Media in Political Awareness In today\u0026rsquo;s digital age, media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception of politics. Social media platforms provide spaces for dialogue and debate but can also spread misinformation that distorts political realities. An informed citizenry is vital for a functioning democracy; however, misinformation often serves as an obstacle for accountability among corrupt politicians.\nConclusion Politics dictates every aspect of our lives. Even if not all of us are interested in being politicians, it is essential to be aware of our rights and responsibilities as citizens. By exercising these rights fully and engaging with our communities, we can bring about positive changes that enhance our quality of life. Understanding the role of politics empowers us to hold our leaders accountable and advocate for a better future for all.\n","permalink":"//localhost:9218/posts/role-of-politics-in-common-peoples-lives/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-role-of-politics-in-common-peoples-lives\"\u003eThe Role of Politics in Common People\u0026rsquo;s Lives\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time, politics has been regarded as something only corrupt or evil people participate in.

This has a lot to do with the patriarchal social system and religion.\nThe Goddess Archetype Women are often revered as goddesses, embodying ideals of purity, sacrifice, and devotion. Even the strongest of the women figures in the religious texts, such as Goddess Durga and Goddess Lakshmi are shown as family-centred women, submissive to their male consorts. That’s just one example of religion’s impact. Women in Indian conservative society are expected to fulfil their roles as wives and mothers, while being devoted to their male ‘guardians’. This will earn one the title of ‘goddess’ or ‘pure woman’.\nThe Evil Archetype Conversely, women who defy these roles or assert their independence are often labelled as evil or immoral. Women who challenge patriarchal norms, face social ostracism and stigmatisation. They are often blamed for ‘ruining the Indian culture’, while they ask for equal rights. Of course, how can equal rights be our culture, right?\nCultural and Religious Underpinnings The dichotomy is deeply rooted in cultural narratives and religious texts that dictate women\u0026rsquo;s roles. For instance, the Manusmriti outlines strict guidelines for women\u0026rsquo;s behaviour, emphasising subservience to male authority figures throughout their lives. This religious sanctioning of gender roles perpetuates the cycle of oppression.\nImpact on Career Choices This dichotomy hinders positive societal changes and women empowerment. People who are adherent to such baseless norms will discourage women from higher studies, jobs and other aspirations to become a devoted wife.\nInternalisation and Identity Women who are forced to conform to these patriarchal norms may internalise it and identify themselves as inferior to men and incapable of living independently. They tend to perpetuate this among other younger women in the family and in the society as well.\n","permalink":"//localhost:9218/posts/women-in-dichotomy/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"women-in-dichotomy\"\u003eWomen in Dichotomy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Concept\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen in Indian society have conventionally been portrayed as either of the two - a goddess or an evil creature.
