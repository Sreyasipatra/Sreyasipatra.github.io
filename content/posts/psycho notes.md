## The Predictable Range

- The psychological standards tend to set out a range, called ‘normal’. Everyone beyond this range is a suspect. Someone who cannot be read as accurately as the normal people.
- Why is it important to read people? To predict their behaviour and how they may threaten one’s overall being.

## Reasoning and Beyond

- Backtracking human behaviours is easy if the pattern is identified. But for some folks, a pattern doesn’t exist for long. It keeps changing.
- There is a set of boundaries. When we imagine beyond that, it’s a free space. We can imagine people flying against the law of physics. Nothing other than one’s own mind can stop that.

## Where is the Limit?

- A whole lot of things exist in our imagination. But telling someone what to imagine? That’s some sick level of control. It is not about real or unreal, rational or irrational; it is about freedom of thoughts.
- It is not about whether god is there or not; nor is it about believing in god’s existence or the one true form, but what we are allowed to think about god. The difference between a religious belief and imagination is the limit. It’s not just limiting one’s own imagination, but limiting others’ imaginations as well.

## Eliminating Deviations

- Sure, we want to imprison the predators and killers and the corrupt people in power. But does it really have anything to do with deviance? Does one having different psychological traits make them commit crimes? The definition of crime is a discussion for another day.
- Do we institutionalise them because they are harmful to common people or is it to safeguard the ignorance?

## A Big Dream

- A person with a vision is scary to the preserver of the status quo.
- Knowing the reality and daring to defy it.
- The transition from reality to dream or vice-versa.

## Natural Course of Events

- There is no natural course in a world ruled by humans. There are volatile patterns.
- Someone must take the necessary steps to bring about a major change.
- Sure, history can be a guide; but it should not be repeated line by line, that will not work in the context.
- Strategies that have been studied will be detected soon. Hence, novelty is required. That is not reliable.
